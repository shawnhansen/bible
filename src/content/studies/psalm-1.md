### Observation

Blessing is framed negatively first: resist the counsel, paths, and seats of scoffers. Delight is active meditation day and night.

### Interpretation

The tree imagery signals stability that only God's Word provides. Fruitfulness follows rootedness.

### Application

Trade infinite scroll for Scripture meditation blocks. Pair each work sprint with a Psalm to anchor your attention.
